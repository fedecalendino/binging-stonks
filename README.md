# Binging Stonks üìàÔ∏è

Based on the now [deprecated service called "TV Graph"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170930164622/http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0903747), I decided to start this little project to revive the tool (at least locally). The idea behind is actually pretty simple: given a TV show, plot the imdb scores of each episode to see if investing time in it will provide much stonks.

## Examples

### Does your favorite TV show had as much stonks as you thought?
![Avatar: The Last Airbender](/img/avatar-the-last-airbender.png)

### Does the sequel/prequel worth investing like its predecessor?
![Breaking Bad](/img/breaking-bad.png)
![Better Call Saul](/img/better-call-saul.png)

### Should you invest on a show or it will get fucked up in the end? (not stonks)
![Game of Thrones](/img/game-of-thrones.png)
![House of Cards](/img/house-of-cards.png)



### Set Up

The only requirement to run this script locally is to ask [OMDB] an API Key for you here: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx. Once you have it you can set it up as an enviroment variable named `OMDB_API_KEY` (as seen [here](https://github.com/federicocalendino/binging-stonks/blob/master/src/integrations/omdb.py#L11)).


## Notes: 

* Pull Requests are more than welcomed.
* Feel free to post any of the graphs where you want, no need to give credit.
    * Tho it would be nice if you send me a link so I can check what you made!
