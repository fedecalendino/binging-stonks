# Binging Stonks üìàÔ∏è

Based on the now [deprecated service called "TV Graph"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170930164622/http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0903747), I decided to start this little project to revive the tool (at least locally). The idea behind is actually pretty simple: given a TV show, plot the imdb scores of each episode to see if investing time in it will provide much stonks.

## Examples

### Does your favorite TV show had as much stonks as you thought?

### Does the sequel/prequel worth investing like its predecessor?
![Breaking Bad](./img/breaking-bad.png)
![Better Call Saul](./img/better-call-saul.png)

### Should you invest on a show or it will get fucked up in the end? (not stonks)
