# Binging Stonks üìàÔ∏è

Based on the now [deprecated service called "TV Graph"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170930164622/http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0903747), I decided to start this little project to revive the tool (at least locally). The idea behind is actually pretty simple: given a TV show, plot the imdb scores of each episode to see if investing time in it will provide much stonks.
